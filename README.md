WebGL Lorenz attractor
======================
Inspired by http://lab.aerotwist.com/webgl/strange-attractor/<br/>
Lorenz attractor with a bit of shader beauty and my not finished WebGL engine.<br/>
From the times when WebGL was young and rare.

In the begining it may take a while to generate all points, wait a few seconds.

It generates 512*1024 points by default. This value may be adjusted by adding #number after URL. Number will be multipled by 1024.
For example:<br/>
...WebGL/attractor_index.html#128<br/>
will generate 128*1024 points.
